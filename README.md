# Rusty Gitventures

I created this repository just to experiment with the `git2` crate. I'm considering implementing a simple git client in Rust, just for fun.

It is going to be a learning experience for the most part, but I may end up creating something useful in the end.

If I decide to create something useful, it will probably become its own repository.
